#Module 1 assessment code and answers


#1) How many species of ants were in the file?

str(ants)

90


#2) How many rows does the *maples_resolved* object have? What function(s) can you use to calculate that?
nrow(maples_resolved)
dim(maples_resolved)
str(maples_resolved)

10

#3) How many columns does the *birds_resolved* object have? What function(s) can you use to calculate that?
ncol(birds_resolved)
dim(birds_resolved)
str(birds_resolved)

7

#4) How many taxa (from all five datasets) have been flagged as synonyms? Which column contains this information?

length(which(birds_resolved$is_synonym == TRUE))
0
length(which(maples_resolved$is_synonym == TRUE))
1
length(which(ants_resolved$is_synonym == TRUE))
0
length(which(conifers_resolved$is_synonym == TRUE))
0
length(which(frogs_resolved$is_synonym == TRUE))
5

#total of 6 across all datasets which can be found in the is_synonym column (TRUE) of each dataset

#5) Which dataset(s) (**object(s)**) contain(s) taxa that have no taxonomic problems, ambiguities or name changes/synonyms (at the taxonomic level studied)? Explain.

#conifers_resolved has no flags, no synonyms, no approxiate matches and only one match per name at the genus level
#ants_resolved has several flags (sibling_higher), many approximate matches, and several taxa which have multiple name matches 
#birds_resolved has one flag (sibling_higher) but otherwise has no taxonomic issues at the genus level
#maples_resolved has one synonym and three names with multiple matches
#frogs_resolved has several synonyms and an orthographic error

#6) Give an example of an **orthographic** or spelling error from one of the datasets (**objects**) and one example of a synonym due to the movement from a species from one genus to another.

#orthographic error
Spea intermontana/us

#synonyms
Acer saccharum subsp. nigrum
Rana sylvatica
Rana catesbeiana
Rana clamitans
Rana pipiens
Pseudacris regilla

#weird issues that could be synonyms or mismatches
Temnothorax formosus
Myrmica lobifrons
Monomorium firmum
Acanthomyops subglaber
Nysius angustatus
Formica gravida
Formica rufibarbis
Formica gagates
Formica longiventris

#7) What might you conclude about the taxonomy of the ant species? Do you have confidence in the names that were matched?

#There might be a gap in our understanding of the taxonomy of these species, the database may be incomplete,
#recent taxonomic changes may have been done which resulted in synonyms (but which were not flagged as synonyms). 
#Further investigation into the taxonomic inconsistencies may be required before proceding further with this clade. 


#8) Are you able to determine which of the five datasets contains the most species? Why or why not?
 
#No, because we only have genus-level information for two of the datasets. 


#9) How many **species** (including **hybrid species** which are indicated by "X") of *Abies* were retrieved? How many of *Picea*?

length(species_conifers$Abies$taxonname)
nrow(species_conifers$Abies)
16

length(species_conifers$Picea$taxonname)
nrow(species_conifers$Picea)
12

#10) Pick a **genus** that you're fond of and retrieve the names of **species** within that **genus** using one of the two **functions** illustrated in this module. *Requires internet*

species_for_genus <- downstream(genus_name, downto = "species", db = "itis")

species_for_genus2 <- children(genus_name, db = "itis")


#11) Retrieve the taxonomic level below species for the frog dataset. What do you find? Do the same for the conifer dataset. What about for the conifer dataset? (Hint: start with the **objects** containing the lists of **species** for frogs and for conifers. Copy an example of the code given above and edit it in a new line.)

subspecies_frogs <- children(frog_species_list, db = "itis")
subspecies_conifers <- children(conifer_species_list, db = "itis")

subspecies_conifers_df <- rbind(subspecies_conifers$`Abies balsamea`, subspecies_conifers$`Abies concolor`, subspecies_conifers$`Abies lasiocarpa`, subspecies_conifers$`Picea engelmannii`)

#There are 7 taxa below the species level within the conifer dataset and none within the frog dataset


#12) Now, which of our five datasets has the most species? How did you calculate that?

length(conifer_species_list)
36
length(bird_species_list)
29
length(maple_species_list)
10
length(frog_species_list)
13
length(ant_species_list)
90

Welcome to "Understanding taxonomy," a module in the "Using phylogenies to study trait evolution" series.

In this module, we will learn how to download a list of taxa and their corresponding Taxon IDs from an online database: the Open Tree of Life. 

In future modules, we will use these taxa to create phylogenies and study how morphological or ecological traits have evolved for these taxa. 

Before completing this module, it is best if you have completed the "XXXXX" module which gives you an introduction to R Studio, R Projects, running scripts, and troubleshooting. 

This course has several streams and several difficulty levels. Please choose the appropriate datafiles and scripts according to your goals.

Data for each module are generally included as **csv** files. These files are able to be opened manually or using an R script. Each **csv** file contains columns separated by **commas** ( , ) and rows separated by **new line characters**.

Navigate to the "Data" folder in the "Files" tab (bottom right corner of the screen) and within that, to the "Introduction_example" folder. Open the file "Acer_rubrum.csv" **manually** by clicking on it and selecting "View File" and check it out. It should look like this:


![Image of csv file as opened manually](../Admin/Images/csv_file.png)

Now, open the same file using **R**. To run the code below, select the row(s) of text and hit the "Run" button above and "Run Selected Lines". 

```{r reading_csv_file}

example_file <- read.csv("../Data/Introduction_example/Acer_rubrum.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
head(example_file)

```

We can use several functions to learn more about our dataset. For example, we can use *nrow()* to count how many rows there are in the dataset. Try it now. How many rows are there? What about columns?

```{r counting_rows}
nrow(example_file)

ncol(example_file)

```

You will notice that we are using the **object** *example_file* to refer to the dataset. **Objects** are easy ways to assign large amounts of information to a single string of letters and/or numbers. 

Let's assign a single individual row to a new object: *row1*

```{r assigning_object}

row1 <- example_file[1,]

```
In this example, we are assigning the **object** *row1* the value of *example_file[1,]* which represents the first row and all columns of the **object** *example_file* using the **operator** *<-* . Let's see what that looks like. Here, rather than asking to see a subset of the data, as we did above with the *head()* **function**, we can run the **object** itself and see the whole thing. 

```{r view_object}

row1

```

Let's see what just the first column would look like. 

```{r subset_column}

col1 <- example_file[,1]
head(col1)

```


Sometimes it's hard to visualize lots of data at once, which is why the summary tools, viewing a subset, or viewing the structure of the dataset can be useful. 

``` {r summary}

str(example_file)

```

Another important element is the concept of **classes** of **objects**. If the data is a number, it is often stored as a *numeric* or *integer* **class** while words or other groups of letters are stored as *character* **classes**. If you look at column *kingdom*, for example, you can see that it has the **class** *character* while the *gbifID* which is composed of numbers, is stored as *numeric*.

I think that is enough of an introduction for now so let's get into this module!

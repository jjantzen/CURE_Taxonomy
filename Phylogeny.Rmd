```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r getting tree}
#my_tree <- tol_induced_subtree(ott_ids = resolved_names$ott_id)

#mono_id <- tnrs_match_names("Acer")
#mono_tree <- tol_subtree(ott_id = ott_id(mono_id))
#mono_tree

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r get OTT id}

ott_id_birds <- birds_resolved$ott_id
ott_id_ants <- ants_resolved$ott_id
ott_id_maples <- maples_resolved$ott_id
ott_id_conifers <- conifers_resolved$ott_id
ott_id_frogs <- frogs_resolved$ott_id

```
